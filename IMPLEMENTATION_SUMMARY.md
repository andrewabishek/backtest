- **Same-bar entry/update conflict resolved** âœ…
- **Proper sequential processing implemented** âœ…

### 2. Marking Candle Logic (CORRECTED)

- **Exact high/low prices used (removed fabricated +1/-2 logic)** âœ…
- **Any candle color can update marking levels** âœ…
- **Maximum 3 updates per trade enforced** âœ…
- **25-point SL distance limit enforced** âœ…

### 3. Trade Entry Logic (VALIDATED)

- **Entry triggers on exact marking candle levels** âœ…
- **No premature entries** âœ…
- **Proper 15:00 entry timing confirmed for Trade #1** âœ…

## ðŸ”§ VALIDATED PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT

### Trade #1 Example (VALIDATED):

```
OLD LOGIC:  Entry at 14:53, P&L: -6.3 points (SL hit)
NEW LOGIC:  Entry at 15:00, P&L: +9.5 points (TP hit)
